## Git branch structure
We use git flow with feature/* for all feature / tasks 

## Chain of Command

Flow:

Builder (Lead/Orchestrate) -> Architect (Plan) -> Engineer (Build) -> Auditor (Test) -> Diplomat (Deploy)

Supporting role:

Explorer (Research/Discovery) supports Builder and Architect with fast codebase investigation and evidence-backed handoff notes.

Explorer usage policy (conditional, not default):

- Use Explorer only when discovery is the bottleneck.
- Do not invoke Explorer by default for every build task.
- Invoke Explorer only if one or more are true:
  - Target files/owners are unclear after quick direct search.
  - The change likely spans multiple packages/domains.
  - Risk/dependency mapping is needed before implementation.
- If Architect already has high-confidence file targets and dependencies, skip Explorer.
- Engineer should not repeat broad discovery; only do minimal gap-filling searches required to implement.

Protocol:

- The Bead ID is the source of truth at every hand-off.
- Every stage transition must update the same Bead ID in bd before work is passed onward.
- Builder decomposes user requests, verifies team composition, and delegates each step to the correct subagent(s).
- Required hand-off statuses:
  - Engineer sets `implemented` when coding is complete and ready for audit.
  - Auditor sets `verified` on pass or `changes_requested` on fail.
  - Diplomat sets `in_review` for PR workflow, then closes the Bead on merge/deploy.
- Handoff artifacts must include the Bead ID in notes, PR descriptions, and release communication.

## Mandatory Code Principles Enforcement

- All agents MUST follow `docs/code-principles.md` for implementation and audit decisions.
- Engineer MUST self-check the `docs/code-principles.md` PR checklist before setting a Bead to `implemented`.
- Auditor MUST verify the same checklist and explicitly report any approved exceptions or violations in audit notes.

## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)

Use Beads for all issue tracking. For worktrees, always use `bd worktree create` so the worktree is wired to the shared repo `.beads` database.

Setup workflow:
- `git fetch origin main`
- `bd worktree create worktrees/<descriptive-name> --branch feature/<descriptive-name>`
- `cd worktrees/<descriptive-name>`
- `mise trust && mise install`
- `bun install`

Before coding in a worktree, verify Beads context:
- `bd context --json`
- If `is_worktree=true` and `is_redirected=false`, stop and repair the worktree (it is using an isolated `.beads` and will fail to find the shared DB)

Critical setup notes:
- ALWAYS use bd CLI commands via Bash tool
- NEVER use MCP beads tools
- Daemon is disabled (`BEADS_NO_DAEMON=1`) for worktree safety
- Shared `.beads` lives at repo root and must be used from all worktrees

"Let's Continue" protocol at session start:
- `bd list --status in_progress --json`
- If none, run `bd ready --limit 5 --json`
- Show top priority issue with `bd show <id> --json`

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods.

### Why bd?

- Dependency-aware: Track blockers and relationships between issues
- Git-friendly: Dolt-powered version control with native sync
- Agent-optimized: JSON output, ready work detection, discovered-from links
- Prevents duplicate tracking systems and confusion

### Quick Start

**Check for ready work:**

```bash
bd ready --json
```

**Create new issues:**

```bash
bd create "Issue title" --description="Detailed context" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 --json
bd create "Issue title" --description="What this issue is about" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123 --json
```

**Claim and update:**

```bash
bd update <id> --claim --json
bd update bd-42 --priority 1 --json
```

**Complete work:**

```bash
bd close bd-42 --reason "Completed" --json
```

### Issue Types

- `bug` - Something broken
- `feature` - New functionality
- `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)
- `epic` - Large feature with subtasks
- `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)

### Priorities

- `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
- `1` - High (major features, important bugs)
- `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)
- `3` - Low (polish, optimization)
- `4` - Backlog (future ideas)

### Workflow for AI Agents

1. **Check ready work**: `bd ready` shows unblocked issues
2. **Claim your task atomically**: `bd update <id> --claim`
3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document
4. **Discover new work?** Create linked issue:
   - `bd create "Found bug" --description="Details about what was found" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`
5. **Complete**: `bd close <id> --reason "Done"`

### Quality
- Use `--acceptance` and `--design` fields when creating issues
- Use `--validate` to check description completeness

### Lifecycle
- `bd defer <id>` / `bd supersede <id>` for issue management
- `bd stale` / `bd orphans` / `bd lint` for hygiene
- `bd human <id>` to flag for human decisions
- `bd formula list` / `bd mol pour <name>` for structured workflows

### Auto-Sync

bd automatically syncs via Dolt:

- Each write auto-commits to Dolt history
- Use `bd dolt push`/`bd dolt pull` for remote sync
- No manual export/import needed!

### Important Rules

- ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking
- ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use
- ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies
- ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking "what should I work on?"
- ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists
- ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers
- ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems

For more details, see README.md and docs/QUICKSTART.md.

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

## Session Completion
